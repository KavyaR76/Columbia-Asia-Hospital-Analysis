# Columbia Asia Hospital Analysis

A healthcare data analytics project using **SQL** and **Power BI** to uncover critical insights from emergency room (ER) visit data. The project focuses on improving patient satisfaction, operational efficiency, and departmental performance across Columbia Asia’s hospital services.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes over 9,000 ER patient records to assess satisfaction trends, visit patterns, departmental revenue, and wait times. Insights generated are aimed at enhancing healthcare delivery and supporting data-driven decision-making.


## 🧩 Objectives

- Understand patient satisfaction across age, gender, and race demographics.
- Identify peak hours and optimize staff scheduling based on visit trends.
- Analyze department-level revenue and wait time performance.
- Monitor doctor performance using KPIs such as average satisfaction, billing, and visit count.


## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

### 🧮 SQL (MySQL)

- Used **JOINS**, **CTEs**, **subqueries**, **CASE** statements, and **window functions**.
- Performed aggregations to extract:
  - Patient visits by department, gender, and age group
  - Departmental revenue and monthly billing trends
  - Doctor-wise satisfaction scores
  - Discount distribution analysis

### 📊 Power BI

- Built interactive dashboards with:
  - Filters by department, doctor, age group, gender, and race
  - Slicers for dynamic time-based analysis (month/year)
  - Visual KPIs (Total Revenue, Avg Wait Time, Avg Satisfaction Score, Total Visits)
  - Visuals: bar charts, line graphs, matrix tables, donut charts


## 📈 Key Insights

- **Orthopedics** and **General Practice** are the top revenue-generating departments.
- **Medium discounts** show the highest correlation with satisfaction improvement.
- **Female patients** make up 53% of visits with comparable satisfaction to males.
- **Senior patients (60+)** have the longest wait times and slightly lower satisfaction.
- **Pacific Islander** and **Native American** patients report highest satisfaction scores.
- **Peak engagement** seen during 11 AM–2 PM and on Mondays & Tuesdays.


## ✅ Recommendations

1. Prioritize Orthopedics and General Practice for targeted investment.
2. Increase staffing during peak hours to reduce wait times.
3. Extend medium-discount programs to more departments and age groups.
4. Deploy satisfaction tracking dashboards per doctor for performance improvement.
5. Create senior-friendly service lanes and priority queues.
6. Introduce multilingual support and awareness sessions for racially diverse groups.
7. Use Power BI reports for weekly department-level performance reviews.
